I am an assistant professor of physics at the [Université de Lyon](https://fst-physique.univ-lyon1.fr/). I lead the Subglacial Hydrodynamics and Ice-Water Interactions (SHIWI) research team at the [Laboratoire de Physique of ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE). 
Our goal is to improve forecasts of the melting of polar ice caps and guide the exploration of subsurface lakes and oceans on icy planets and moons in the solar system. To this end, we investigate the hydrodynamics of subglacial water environments and the physics of ice-ocean interactions using high-resolution numerical simulations. We are aiming to set up a laboratory experiment of melting ice in water to complement our computational efforts in the coming years.

Announcements
------
I do not have PhD or postdoctoral funded positions to offer at the moment.
Prospective students and postdocs with an interest in ocean and atmospheric dynamics, the cryosphere, and/or space exploration (icy moons) are yet encouraged to send me an email as funding opportunities can arise anytime!
