## Modelling Ice-shelf Melting and ice-Ocean Processes via the phase-field method and direct numerical simulation
*2018-*

PI: L-A Couston

Collaborators: Eric Hester (USyd), Benjamin Favier (IRPHE), John Taylor (DAMTP), Adrian Jenkins (Northumbria), Paul Holland (BAS)

**Overarching Question:** How quickly do ice blocks melt in lakes and oceans?

**Goals:**
1. Spontaneous generation of roughness and topography at the water/ice interface
1. Influence of boundary roughness and topography on ice melting in lakes and oceans

## Subglacial Lake Dynamics
*2019-* 

PI: L-A Couston

Collaborators: Martin Siegert (Imperial College)

**Overarching Question:** Are hydrodynamic conditions conducive to life in Antarctic subglacial lakes?

**Goals:**
1. Stability of subglacial lakes against geothermal heating
1. Intensity of fluid motions in subglacial lakes unstable to geothermal heating
