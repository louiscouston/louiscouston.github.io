I am an assistant professor of physics at the [Université de Lyon](https://fst-physique.univ-lyon1.fr/). I lead the Subglacial Hydrodynamics and Ice-Water Interactions (SHIWI) research team at the [Laboratoire de Physique of ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE). 
Our goal is to improve forecasts of the melting of polar ice caps and guide the exploration of subsurface lakes and oceans on icy planets and moons in the solar system. To this end, we investigate the hydrodynamics of subglacial water environments and the physics of ice-ocean interactions using high-resolution numerical simulations. We are aiming to set up a laboratory experiment of melting ice in water to complement our computational efforts in the coming years. 

Physical Systems That Motivate Our Work
------
* Oceans and lakes
* Polar ice sheets
* Ice shelves and ice-shelf ocean cavities
* Icebergs
* Subglacial lakes
* Supraglacial lakes and rivers
* Subsurface water on icy moons 
* Earth's equatorial atmosphere
* Coastal waters

The Long Shot
------
We have currently four long-term goals:
* We aim to guide the development of the next generation of ocean models by proposing new parameterizations of phase changes at ice-water interfaces realiable in all conditions.
* We aim to guide the exploration of extreme environments of interests to astrobiology by quantitatively assessing the dynamics of subglacial water on Earth and Icy Moons.
* We aim to guide the analysis and modelling of equatorial zonal winds (such as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on Earth) by unravelling their relationship to atmospheric turbulence and waves.  
* We aim to propose an industry-ready algorithm providing best practices for coastal protection and enhanced wave energy extraction via engineering of seabed topography.  

Questions We Have Started To Address Via Investigations Of Thermo-Mechanical Dynamics Of Geophysical Fluids
------
* What waves does turbulence generate?
* How do internal waves mix oceans?
* Can we predict zonal winds in Earth's equatorial stratosphere?
* Can we identify the physical processes controlling the melting of ice shelves and icebergs?
* Can seabed topography protect coastlines from ocean waves?
* Does water move around in subglacial lakes?
* How long can subsurface water lenses in icy moons survive before they freeze?
* Are ice sheets impacted by the presence of subglacial lakes?

Currently-Active Research Projects
------
* Dynamics of rotating subglacial lakes 
* Dynamics of Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation
* Physics of ice melting in salt water

Announcements
------
I do not have PhD or postdoctoral funded positions to offer at the moment.
Prospective students and postdocs with an interest in ocean and atmospheric dynamics, the cryosphere, and/or space exploration (icy moons) are yet encouraged to send me an email as funding opportunities can arise anytime! You may also check out [Campus France](https://www.campusfrance.org/en), [Campus Bourse](https://campusbourses.campusfrance.org/#/catalog) and the [Foreign Affairs](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france/etudier-en-france/financer-son-projet-d-etudes-en-france/) webpages for funding opportunities.

PhD students abroad may have the opportunity to visit our lab 12 months through the [Effeil grant](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france/etudier-en-france/financer-son-projet-d-etudes-en-france/). Please send me an email if your PhD topic fits our research interests.

Postdoctoral researchers (especially with previous postdoc experience) are strongly encouraged to apply for the [Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), which is a prestigious fellowship that is often used as a way to subsequently obtain a job in academia. The program [Make our planet great](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/mopga-make-our-planet-great-again-funding-programs) again offers a 1-year postdoc fellowship, with a start date in september 2022. Please send me an email if you're interested in joining our lab to work on ice-ocean and ice-lake interactions or more generally geophysical fluid dynamics. CNES (space agency) also offers 2-year [postdoctoral fellowships](https://cnes.fr/en/web/CNES-en/7430-research-grants.php) that may support research on icy moons and dwarf planets.
