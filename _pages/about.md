I am an assistant professor of physical oceanography and physics at the [Université de Lyon](https://fst-physique.univ-lyon1.fr/) and at the [Laboratoire de Physique of ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE). I am a physicist with expertise in geophysical fluid dynamics, physical oceanography and ice-ocean interactions. I aim to discover how turbulence (the root cause of many unsolved problems in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics), waves, phase changes (ice ablation) and large-scale flows interact and shape the environment we live in. I specialize in the analysis of idealized complex flows in nature primarily using turbulence-resolving numerical simulations but also laboratory experiments since joining ENS de Lyon. Local collaborators have expertise in turbulence research, laboratory experiments, statistical mechanics and topology and include [Romain Volk](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/romain.volk/), [Sylvain Joubaud](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/sylvain.joubaud/), [Antoine Venaille](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/antoine.venaille/), [Julien Salort](https://www.juliensalort.org/en/) and [Francesca Chillà](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/presentation/annuaire/chilla-francesca).

Current research interests include: (i) modelling of the ice-shelf--ocean boundary layer, (ii) morphological stability and dynamics of ice-ocean interfaces, (iii) dynamics of subglacial lakes, (iv) dynamics of subglacial water environments on icy moons, (v) wave--mean-flow interactions and (vi) statistical learning methods for reduced-order climate modelling.

Computational Tools And Ressources
------
* Occasionaly we write our own codes (Python, Matlab, Julia... soon)
* Most often we use the (awesome!) open-source pseudo-spectral code [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/)
* And we use the open-source spectral-element code [Nek5000](https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/) when we consider complex geometries
* High-performance high-CPU count simulations are often run on our local supercomputer [PSMN](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PSMN/doku.php)
* Though we also have experience running on other supercomputers, including [NASA Pleiades](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/resources/pleiades.html) and [CINECA Marconi](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hardware/marconi)

Contact
------
If you're looking for me or want to reach out, try
* my email: louis.couston[AT]ens-lyon.fr, or 
* my office: M1 020, ENS de Lyon, 46, allée d’Italie, 69007, Lyon, France. 

Note that I go by Louis, altough my full first name is Louis-Alexandre.

Announcements
------
I do not have PhD or postdoctoral funded positions to offer at the moment.
Prospective students and postdocs with an interest in ocean and atmospheric dynamics, the cryosphere, and/or space exploration (icy moons) are yet encouraged to send me an email as funding opportunities can arise anytime! You may also check out [Campus France](https://www.campusfrance.org/en), [Campus Bourse](https://campusbourses.campusfrance.org/#/catalog) and the [Foreign Affairs](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france/etudier-en-france/financer-son-projet-d-etudes-en-france/) webpages for funding opportunities.

PhD students abroad may have the opportunity to visit our lab 12 months through the [Effeil grant](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france/etudier-en-france/financer-son-projet-d-etudes-en-france/). Please send me an email if your PhD topic fits our research interests.

Postdoctoral researchers (especially with previous postdoc experience) are strongly encouraged to apply for the [Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), which is a prestigious fellowship that is often used as a way to subsequently obtain a job in academia. The program [Make our planet great again](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/mopga-make-our-planet-great-again-funding-programs) offers a 1-year postdoc fellowship, with a start date in september 2022. Please send me an email if you're interested in joining our lab to work on ice-ocean and ice-lake interactions or more generally geophysical fluid dynamics. CNES (space agency) also offers 2-year [postdoctoral fellowships](https://cnes.fr/en/web/CNES-en/7430-research-grants.php) that may support research on icy moons and dwarf planets.
