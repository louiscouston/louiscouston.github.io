My full name is Louis-Alexandre Couston, but I go by Louis! Since 09/2020, I joined the [department of Physics at the University of Lyon](https://fst-physique.univ-lyon1.fr/) and the [Laboratoire de Physique ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE) as an assistant professor. If you're looking for me, your best chance is to either send me an email (louis.couston[AT]ens-lyon.fr) or check my office (M1 020, ENS de Lyon, 46, allée d’Italie, 69007, Lyon, France).
