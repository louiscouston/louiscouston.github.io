## Subglacial Ocean Dynamics (small scales)

The ablation of ice (through melting or dissolution) from the base of ice shelves is controlled by ocean turbulence.

Our goal is to address the question: **How quickly do ice blocks melt in lakes and oceans?**

**Goals:**
1. Spontaneous generation of roughness and topography at the water/ice interface
1. Influence of boundary roughness and topography on ice melting in lakes and oceans


## Subglacial Ocean Dynamics (large scales)



## Subglacial Lake Dynamics
*2019-* 

PI: L-A Couston

Collaborators: Martin Siegert (Imperial College)

**Overarching Question:** Are hydrodynamic conditions conducive to life in Antarctic subglacial lakes?

**Goals:**
1. Stability of subglacial lakes against geothermal heating
1. Intensity of fluid motions in subglacial lakes unstable to geothermal heating
