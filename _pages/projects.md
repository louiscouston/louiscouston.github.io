## Modelling Ice-shelf Melting and ice-Ocean Processes via the phase-field method and direct numerical simulation
*2018-*

PI: L-A Couston

Collaborators: Eric Hester (USyd), Benjamin Favier (IRPHE), John Taylor (DAMTP), Adrian Jenkins (Northumbria), Paul Holland (BAS)

**Overarching Question:** Are hydrodynamic conditions conducive to life in Antarctic subglacial lakes?

**Goals:**
1. Stability of subglacial lakes against geothermal heating
1. Intensity of fluid motions in subglacial lakes unstable to geothermal heating
