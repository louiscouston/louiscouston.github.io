## Subglacial Ocean Dynamics (small scales)

An outstanding question in polar oceanography is:  
**How quickly do ice shelf melt or dissolve from heat and salt fluxes conveyed by the ocean?**

This question is difficult to address because heat and salt exchanges between the base of ice shelves and subglacial oceans are controlled by turbulent motions, whose sensitivities to environmental conditions are unknown (e.g., sensitivity to near ice ocean current velocity, which can significantly vary between ice shelves). 

Our group tackles this question by running turbulence-resolving simulations of the ice-ocean boundary layer, using environmental conditions (prescribed background state and forcings) inspired from observations. Our simulations can model explicitly deformations of the ice-water interface due to melting or freezing, allowing us to investigate whether long-lived interfacial patterns spontaneously emerge and modify the mean ice ablation rate. Results obtained from simulations will be soon extended to computationally-extreme conditions (high Reynolds number flows) using novel, state-of-the-art laboratory experiments of ice ablation in stratified, externally-forced salt water.    

Our work will unravel fundamental features (or colors) of turbulence that are unique to subglacial environments and ultimately aims to decipher the relationship between ice ablation rate and environmental ocean flow conditions, paving the way for reliable parameterizations of ice ablation in coarse regional or global ocean models that cannot explicitly model the underlying, rate-controlling small-scale motions.

Coming soon.

## Subglacial Lake Dynamics

An outstanding question in astrobiology is:
**What is the fluid dynamics of extraterrestrial, subglacial, aquatic environments?**

This question is of importance because subglacial aquatic environments, expected on numerous icy moons (Enceladus, Europa) and possibly beneath Mars' polar ice cap, are the most likely places to have (had) extraterrestrial life forms in the solar system. Subglacial aquatic environments are very different from open oceans and surface lakes. They are isolated from winds and solar radiations, yet can maintain vigorous flows thanks to geothermal heating and interfacial temperature gradients controlled by the cavity geometry.  

Our group tackles this question by running simulations of subglacial aquatic systems, unravelling their large-scale dynamics while resolving turbulence. Current configurations of interest are inspired from subglacial lakes on Earth, as they are the terrestrial analogues of subglacial aquatic environments on icy moons, hence are accessible such that field explorations will provide in the near future means to challenge our predictions.
