The MIMOP project aims to answer the question:  
__How quickly do ice shelves melt ?__  
and received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie
Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement 793450.

## News

I moved from the British Antarctic Survey to the Université de Lyon on Setpember 1st 2020. 

## Background

Most of the ice of our planet calls home Antarctica. But it is a fragile place. As temperatures rise both in the atmosphere and the oceans, grounded ice and floating ice on and around the Antarctic continent are melting increasingly rapidly. Snow falls, which used to balance melting, haven't picked up the pace. As a result, more and more ice is being transformed into southern ocean water and one should expect sea levels to rise in the 21st century much faster than we humans ever witnessed.

## Goal

The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is mostly grounded but some it is floating. We call the ice chunks attached to the grounded ice but floating above sea water ice shelves. Ice shelves are a critical component of the AIS. The thicker they are, the more they oppose the gravitational flow of ice from the Antarctic centre to the margins. Recent observations show that ice shelves are melting and thinning increasingly rapidly, which opens the door to faster flows of the AIS into the southern ocean. So, yes, the polar regions are changing. But can we predict how quickly this change is going to take place?

Figure (a) above is a schematic of an ice-shelf cavity. An ice-shelf cavity can be quite large. It can cover an horizontal area up to 1000,000 square kilometers, the ice-shelf can be up to 1 kilometer thick, and the water column can be 1 kilometer deep. The cavity experiences intrusions of

## Perspectives


**Leading question:** How quickly does ice melt in lakes and oceans ?

<summary>Topography of the ice/water interface</summary>
 
* Is the ice/water interface naturally smooth or rough ?
* How does interface topography change ice melting ?
