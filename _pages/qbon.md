**Overarching question:** How much can we say about a planetary object from the movement of fluids ?

## Planned investigations
**QBO flows in oceans**
**QBO flows in planetary cores**

## Past investigations
**Fundamentals of QBO flows**

1. What controls the emergence of QBO flows ? 
1. How is the variability of QBO flows related to the wave and turbulence dynamics ? 

Collaborators: Michael Le Bars, Benjamin Favier (IRPHE, CNRS), Daniel Lecoanet (Northwestern)
