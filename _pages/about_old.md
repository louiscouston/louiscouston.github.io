My name is Louis-Alexandre Couston and I am an assistant professor of physics at the [Université de Lyon](https://fst-physique.univ-lyon1.fr/) and [ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE) since 09/2020. 

If you're looking for me or want to reach out, try
* my email: louis.couston[AT]ens-lyon.fr, or 
* my office: M1 020, ENS de Lyon, 46, allée d’Italie, 69007, Lyon, France. 

Announcements
------
I do not have PhD or postdoctoral funded positions to offer at the moment.
Prospective students or postdocs with an interest in ocean and atmospheric physics, the cryosphere, and/or space exploration (icy moons) are still encouraged to send me an email as funding opportunities can arise anytime!

* Fluid mechanics (M1)(TD)

Current Teaching (Fall 2020)
------
* Thermodynamics and heat transfers: Part I (L1)(CM/TD/TP)

* Fluid mechanics (M1)(TD)

* SLD: Subglacial Lake Dynamics (active)

* SCENT: upSCale Energy transfers in NaTure (dormant)


Brief CV
------
*I've spent 7 years abroad. Don't hesitate to ask if you're interested in moving to or collaborating with the UK or US.*

Research Interests
------
*These are the kind of keywords that go into the paper I write.*

* Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (turbulence, waves, large-scale flows, stratification, rotation)

* Hydrodynamics (instability, wave scattering, wave-wave resonance)
